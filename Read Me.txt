To run: allow all the files enclosed in the same directory. 

Run PlaneSweep.java and BruteForce.java

Both Programs BruteForce.java and PlaneSweep.java run on file inputs (names "segments.txt")

Both produce a file output (named: "output.txt")

I have taken Point class with double type x and y co-ordinates. 
This is because the segments could intersect at non interger values. 
When 2 points of intersection very close to each other may be rounded 
to the same point if they were int values. 

Using double prevents this from happening. 
I have rounded the double values upto 2 decimal places.
